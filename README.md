# Hobby-Page
My first project for Founders And Coders.


# Planning
To begin with I have to do a setup and connect my github account and my local computer in order to save any changes. Then I will try to visualise the hobby page itself how I would like it to look like according to the given requirements by Founders And Coders. Once I have a plan in my head for the project I will create a prototype for it that I can use as a blueprint to build the page.


# Building
As I mentioned above first I create a prototype for the project. In order to do this I open figma and design the prototype that I alreadt visualised in my head. Once I have the figma prototype I will begin coding. In VS Code I create an index.html for the conetnt of the page and an index.css to style it. I will also need an index.js to store my javascript code for the function this project needs.


# Debugging
Make this about the date javascript function.
